## SAM3X8E Driver

A GrblHAL driver for the Atmel SAM3X8E processor on a [Arduino Due board](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-due).

Pin mappings for a selection of shields/boards can be found [here](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/tree/master/drivers/SAM3X8E/Arduino%20Due%20shield%20pin%20mappings).

This driver compiles and uploads from the Arduino IDE and is partially dependent on the Arduino framework.
